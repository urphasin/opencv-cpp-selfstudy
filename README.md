# OpenCV C++ Self-Study
A structured approach to mastering OpenCV with C++.

## ðŸ“Œ What Each Part Does

- **01-basics/**: Load images, draw, read webcam â€“ absolute fundamentals.
- **02-image-processing/**: Filters, edge detection, basic transformations.
- **03-object-detection/**: Use contours, Haar cascades, motion tracking.
- **04-deep-learning/**: Run pre-trained models with OpenCV DNN module.
- **05-projects/**: Real-world applications combining everything you've learned.
- **include/**: Put reusable utility headers (e.g., helper functions).
- **resources/**: Store images, videos, and model files.
